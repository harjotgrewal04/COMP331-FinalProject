# **COMP331-FinalProject**

## **Project Description**
  This project focuses on data preprocessing before the next step of training a machine elarning model or applying data mining. In real-world datasets they contain various issues which can ruin the training process of a machine learning model and ruin the accuracy of it. To demonstrate this I took a student performance dataset and used AI to create a more "messy" version of it which allows to show statistics based upon the quality of this dataset using various metrics.

  Some of the key data quality dimensions which this project looks at includes completeness, consistency, validity, bias & sampling analysis and lastly feature quality. Each of these metrics check to make sure the dataset is well rounded. Completeness will scan for any missing values where ocnsistency makes sure the dataset input is unform across multiple platforms allowing for easy access. Validity ensures that numeric fields do not include any outliers and make check the ranges of data and also the bias and samplying analysis will make sure the dataset fairly represents all of the demographic groups. Lastly while feature quality is not a data quality dimension it lets us know which features are most correlated and important. 

  Overall, this project shows key data quality issues in datasets which can be present in real-world situations and how they need to be handled. This proejct also includes graphs and charts to better demonstrate distrubution of different features apart of the dataset. Learning how to analyze a dataset is a crucial step in various applications which are applied and used in the real-world.
